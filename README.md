**General Context of PriceSync**
Small vendors face a common challenge in managing the prices of their products on e-commerce platforms, which often prevents them from digitizing their business and losing a crucial source of revenue through this sales channel. PriceSync emerges as a solution from Pricing Engine to address this problem, offering an efficient price management tool and integration with e-commerce platforms without the friction and complexities commonly encountered in this process.

Several stakeholders are involved in generating and delivering this value to those who need it. These include:

	•	E-commerce platform representatives, who are strategic partners for PriceSync to ensure the service adds value to customers.
	•	Investors in Pricing Engine who want to monitor how their resources are being used and the return on their investment.
	•	The executive team at Pricing Engine, who are betting that the new product will be a great success for the company.
	•	The scrum team leading the product development comprises the development team, scrum master, and product owner.

The **scrum team** consists of the following members:

	•	Humberto: The Product Owner with excellent communication skills, knowledge of Pricing Engine’s business and the e-commerce market, and an understanding of how technology can solve business problems.
	•	Pedro: Mid-level developer on the development team, specializing in frontend-related code.
	•	Andre: Senior developer on the development team, skilled in both backend and frontend, with backend development being his strong suit.
	•	Rafael: Junior developer on the team, primarily responsible for setting up necessary tests while learning from others to advance in his career.
	•	Marcos: Scrum Master of the team, ensuring productive workflow based on the scrum framework for the team’s day-to-day activities.

The target audience for PriceSync includes small vendors who want to digitize and face difficulties managing their product prices on various e-commerce platforms. This might result in a different client than the user of the product. For example, in some cases, the client may be the business owner, while the user will manage the PriceSync tool. Therefore, the product focus is to ensure that both understand the added value of acquiring the service, with the user providing daily feedback and the client providing more sporadic feedback.
